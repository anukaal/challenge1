**First Challenge on Sqli Injection**

To check **SQL** Injection is working or not and whether the query is dumping the data from the Database or not.


Now, I have created four files here for the login system.

$ index.html - This file is created for the GUI view of the login page and empty field validation. 


$ style.css - This file is created for the attractive view of the login form. 


$ connection.php - Connection file contains the connection code for database connectivity.


$ authentication.php - This file validates the form data with the database which is submitted by the user.
